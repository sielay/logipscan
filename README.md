logipcan
========

Small snippet to find out ips occurring in logs
It uses one argument which is path to the log. For example:

```
./logipscan /var/log/mongo/mongo.log
```

Result will be similar to
```
198.20.70.114 from GeoIP Country Edition: US, United States - census3.shodan.io.
```

I bet there are thunsands of better tools, but feel free to use that one, if you find it useful.
